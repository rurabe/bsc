              My girlfriend is currently a student. It took me so long to find her the best prices online, that I decided to make the process easier. Book Supply Co. is the result of that, and is here to help everyone else out.

              Our partners give us a small percentage of the books that you order, but the price they charge you is <i>exactly the same</i> as if you had gone there yourself. They pay us, and you save money and time. Win-win!

              Not exactly. We're not selling anything, just providing a service that figures out what books you need, presents you with some great online options, and links you straight to the choice you make. You are purchasing the books from the online bookstores (Amazon or Barnes and Noble) themselves after we link you to them.

              Book Supply Co. searches the web using the precise ISBN13 (also known as EAN) for the exact book that your teacher specified. Because of this, you will always get the exact version of the book your class requires.

              Yep! If your school does this, however, there is a very low chance that your version is for sale online. But if for some reason they do, you will know that it is the exact version you need for class.

              That's something that you can choose when you check out with Amazon or Barnes and Noble. If you need your books faster, you'll probably pay more, but if you can wait a few days, shipping is usually free over $25. Amazon is actually offering <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info?ie=UTF8&refcust=HR7XOWUQOG6SMYEDL5FJBQACTU&ref_type=generic' target='_blank'>free 2 day shipping with Amazon Student.</a> That can be a good option for getting your books quickly and cheaply.

              There is always a tension that exists between ease and security, but our mission is to make buying books cheaply as easy as possible. We decided that instead of:
              <ul>
                <li>logging in to your school's website,</li>
                <li>finding your booklist,</li>

              <p>Honestly, we find it much easier to make money by sending you to get your books cheaply from our partners than it is to scam people. We are so paranoid about your security that we don't even record your login or password-so we have no records that someone else could come steal from us.</p>

              Well first off, all your information is sent using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which makes it near impossible for anyone to intercept your data. You can tell it's working because there will usually be a lock next to the URL and it will say https:// instead of http://. But the best security is the fact that we don't ever record your information, so it can never be stolen.
